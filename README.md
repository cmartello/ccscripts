ccscripts
=========

This is a collection of scripts for the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft (which is used in a number of mod packs, notably Feed the Beast.)

INSTALLATION
============
It depends :)

For my own usage, I've copied my scripts to ~/.minecraft/mods/ComputerCraft/lua/rom/programs to make everything readable by any computer or turtle to use as needed.  For SMP, you may need to beg your friendly neighborhood admin to put copies of these scripts on the server.  Alternatly, there's CC-get and the pastebin plugin.

SCRIPTS

miner.lua -- digs a vertical shaft, a 3x3 tunnel, and then a 2x2 tunnel with alcoves spaced 3 meters apart.  Useful for layered branch mining.

More to come :)
